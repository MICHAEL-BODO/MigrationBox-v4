## ⚡ LUMESIA-READY CAPABILITIES

### 1. Voice-to-Infrastructure Planning (15-minute design)
*Development: 2 weeks | Complexity: Medium*

Natural language → Production architecture design using Extended Thinking.

**How It Works**:
- Speak: "Migrate Rome datacenter to GCP Milan region"
- Extended Thinking analyzes 105+ variables
- Generates complete migration architecture
- Validates compliance (GDPR, ISO27001)
- Estimates timeline + cost

**Value**: 20x faster than manual planning

### 2. Multi-Cloud Discovery Engine (1000 servers/hour)  
*Development: 3 weeks | Complexity: Medium*

Automated scanning of on-prem + cloud environments.

**Discovers**:
- Compute (VMware, Hyper-V, EC2, Azure VM, GCE)
- Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, Oracle)
- Storage (NAS, SAN, S3, Blob, GCS)
- Networks (VLANs, firewalls, load balancers)
- Dependencies (auto-mapped in Neo4j graph)

**Value**: Eliminates 80% manual discovery work

### 3. AI-Powered Risk Assessment
*Development: 2 weeks | Complexity: Low*

Extended Thinking evaluates migration risk across 100+ variables.

**Assesses**:
- Dependency complexity
- Data sensitivity
- Compliance requirements
- Timeline constraints
- Cost implications

**Outputs**: Risk score (0-100) + mitigation plans

### 4. Zero-Downtime Migration Orchestration
*Development: 4 weeks | Complexity: High*

Temporal.io workflows coordinate multi-step migrations.

**Workflow**:
1. Pre-validation (connectivity, permissions)
2. Backup (automated snapshots)
3. Provisioning (Terraform deployment)
4. Data sync (CDC replication)
5. Validation (5-dimension checks)
6. Cutover (<15 min downtime)
7. Post-validation
8. Cleanup

**Value**: <15min downtime vs 4-8 hours traditional

### 5. Autonomous Failure Detection & Recovery
*Development: 3 weeks | Complexity: Medium*

24/7 monitoring with self-healing capabilities.

**Detects**:
- Connection failures
- Performance degradation
- Data inconsistencies
- Security violations

**Auto-Remediates**: 95% of issues without human intervention
**MTTR**: 2 minutes vs 12 hours traditional

### 6. Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard
*Development: 2 weeks | Complexity: Low*

Next.js dashboard with WebSocket updates.

**Shows**:
- Migration progress (real-time)
- Agent status (6 AI agents)
- Resource utilization
- Cost tracking
- Compliance status

### 7. Compliance Validation Engine
*Development: 2 weeks | Complexity: Medium*

Automated validation against regulatory frameworks.

**Frameworks**:
- GDPR (EU data residency)
- ISO27001 (security controls)
- PCI-DSS (if applicable)
- SOC 2 (if needed)

**Output**: Compliance reports + gap analysis

### 8. Cost Optimization Engine  
*Development: 3 weeks | Complexity: Medium*

8 cost analyzers with auto-remediation.

**Analyzes**:
- Right-sizing opportunities
- Reserved instance recommendations
- Spot instance eligibility
- Storage tiering
- Unused resources
- Network optimization
- License optimization
- Scheduling automation

**Savings**: Typically 30-50% post-migration

### 9. Rollback Automation
*Development: 1 week | Complexity: Low*

<5 minute recovery to pre-migration state.

**How**:
- Automated snapshots before each step
- State tracking in DynamoDB
- One-click rollback via dashboard
- Auto-notification to stakeholders
